# Dog Gone Dining

Created for the Skills USA OTC shootout. 

## Authors/Team
- Landen Brewer
- Lucas Stephans

## Teamwork Summary
Starting off, we created a GitHub repo. This made it to where we
could both continue to work on it even at home. 

We split the project up into pages and decided which 
pages each person should work on. 

Landen got the homepage and the menu. Lucas got the "Rent a friend",
Location, and Catering pages to work on. 

When we met in person, we discussed different aspects of the
site such as color scheme and general layout of pages. We just 
bounced ideas off of each other until we came to an agreement
about what looked good to us.

At home, we communicated through Discord, allowing us to know
what was up with the other persons end of the project. 
For example if there were to ever be a merge conflict we could
figure it out together.
